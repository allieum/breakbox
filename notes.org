cpu usage???
joy stick
maybe never, but try do gate mirroring strictly tied to current volume / play status a la lights




Cool things:
- spice can change current pitch mod value (randomly :))
- step repeat but for last step that was played, with effects recorde`d
  - shorter window on pitch mod cymbals
- allow list for step repeat, latching on other pads
    - So that it only repeats cool sounding noises
    - Have to make these manually by listening with ears and heart
Outside Lands must haves:
- partial_trigger don't break things
- drum vs keys selection
- Gate (for ride):
    - faster hits --> shorter gate interval
    - higher velocity --> shorter gate duty cycle

go thru remove obsolete comments


Aug 3, 2023 todos:
- group cymbal hits, if main hit is paired with rim or bell, ignore main. Allows using breakbox without triggering 404 effects
 vspice mapped to number of drum hits w/ cooloff
- snare roll to toggle loop
  - use other pad than snare: tom3
- step repeat
  - could do retrig, keep repeating as long as you keep hitting pad
  - rate == length
- fix pitch mod
- take away program change
- gate
  - faster hits == shorter gate period
  - velocity --> gate duty cycle
  - try on ride

    unclear how to implement
- program change, map to new knob so you can change breakbox samples without changing drum kit


* wow
** dtx midi ideas:
*** CC 16 general controller (location snare strike)
*** CC 17 ride location

*** bank select 0 MSB, 32 LSB ch10

* even fresher
** use drum kit as "gate" for running sequence
*** midi in
*** quantized or unquantized
** joy stick!!
** pi animations for sample progress
** bigger circle for selected
** smplflp
** DONE bank screen param
