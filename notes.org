CLOSED: [2023-06-11 Sun 08:30]
** DONE fix slower
CLOSED: [2023-06-11 Sun 07:58]

CLOSED: [2023-06-11 Sun 17:40]

CLOSED: [2023-06-11 Sun 17:54]
** DONE dont daisy chain samples into fx chain casualties
CLOSED: [2023-06-11 Sun 17:54]
** DONE pitch mod persistence
CLOSED: [2023-06-11 Sun 17:55]
** DONE bugs where selected sample changes before key release handler
CLOSED: [2023-06-11 Sun 22:15]
** DONE shift to hold fx. if shift => persist fx + loop current sample
CLOSED: [2023-06-12 Mon 12:18]
** TODO also do shift first then fx btns
** stop fx button (shift + stop)
** gate period powers of 2
** for gate mirror use presets
** restrict input range of gate time
** release step repeat key -> others should remain active
** effect btns as momentary unmutes
** instead of invert gates, scramble?
*



** spice n dice
** import directory structure
** normalize volumes, remove click etc
** combinations of step repeat keys
** sample flipping!!
** error about float / generate sound?
* MVP
** DONE stop audio on start / stop
CLOSED: [2023-04-28 Fri 15:24]
** frame size
** mute switch
** DONE fix out of sync on first loop
CLOSED: [2023-04-28 Fri 15:24]
*** start sample later, or wait til next loop
** DONE dont require tr8s to be on first
CLOSED: [2023-04-28 Fri 15:24]
*** handle case where midi connection goes away
** sample rate / mono?
** survey audio quality / clipping w headphones
*** invest in audio hat for better DAC ?

** DONE systemd service
CLOSED: [2023-05-03 Wed 14:04]

* features
** DONE reduce jitter by only syncing @ start of bar
CLOSED: [2023-05-09 Tue 18:25]
** pitch shifting / rate manipulation
** mute patterns
** probability
** DONE allow play without clock
CLOSED: [2023-05-11 Thu 15:48]
** LFO!
*** for volume, pitch, patterns, prob..


* stuff
** preserve original slice sample thru timestretching
** param dna
** db power amp
** xfade on step repeat ? not sure
** can avoid improper sound queueing? maths?
** recording
** bug w step repeat then toggle not work
** variable bpm
** crossfade
** refactor key handlers
** top row should maybe be toggly / nonexclusive
** implement chromatic rate shift
** DONE fix stutter on start w internal clock
CLOSED: [2023-05-19 Fri 08:59]
** playtest midi clock again lol
** bug with sync at beginning when starting all samples at once?
*** could check queue size and bail to recover from this
*** also when sample drops should get next one in current call (while instead of if for timeout check)


* refactory
** state module (current bank, modes, etc)
** constants
** input / kb module
** audio
** sequence
*** beats, clock, etc
** midi
*** connec, reconnec, get msg
** utility

* bugs
** do HOLD on both step repeat and a toggle switch -> stop doesn't stop the sound

* actually to do
** DONE fix bugs
CLOSED: [2023-04-28 Fri 06:51]
** DONE stop on stop
CLOSED: [2023-04-28 Fri 06:51]
