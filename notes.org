** mute patterns
** probability
** DONE allow play without clock

** LFO!
*** for volume, pitch, patterns, prob..



* stuff
** bug w step repeat then toggle not work
** top row should maybe be toggly / nonexclusive
** implement chromatic rate shift
** fix stutter on start w internal clock
** playtest midi clock again lol
** bug with sync at beginning when starting all samples at once?
*** could check queue size and bail to recover from this
*** also when sample drops should get next one in current call (while instead of if for timeout check)

* refactory
** state module (current bank, modes, etc)
** constants
** input / kb module
** audio
** sequence
*** beats, clock, etc
** midi
*** connec, reconnec, get msg
